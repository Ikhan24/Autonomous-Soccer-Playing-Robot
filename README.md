# Autonomous-Soccer-Playing-Robot
## Design Methodologies and Principles
**Overview:** <br/>
Task: Design a robot that implements two functions, attack and defend. The robot should be able to navigate through an obstacle course. When in attack mode, the robot should be able to move to a position good enough to shoot the ball on target (goal) and attempt to score. When in defense mode, the robot should be able to find the goal and set itself in a position to block the ball from entering the goal.<br/>
